    <p>Hey! My name is Hudson Reilly and I am a student at <a href="http://www.fullerton.edu/">CSUF</a>! My major is Comp Sci with an emphasis in Cyber Security.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Lab 10</p>
    <p>  Lab 10, Parts 1 and 2, were both among my favorite labs this semester. I felt that Part 1 was the first time I was able to work hands-on with file input and output streams. In the fields of Data Science and Cybersecurity, being able to read from a file or a webpage is imperative, and automating this process is really fun to see and build. Part 2 was enjoyable because it was my first hands-on approach to two-dimensional vectors in C++. It took me a while to understand and manipulate the vectors I was using, but in the end, I got a hold of what I was doing. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Lab 11</p>
    <p>  During my summer internship, I worked with file input and output using CSV files, so seeing Lab 11 Part 1 made me happy. While my internship involved Python, it&#39;s nice to be able to do it natively in C++ without needing a library like Pandas to speed up the process. The one difficulty I had with this lab was using the ReadCSV function correctly. I probably spent an hour debugging when all I had to do was change a single number. I ended up swapping the rows and columns, so instead of putting 9 as the number of columns, I mistakenly put 67.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Lab 12</p>
    <p>  10, 11, and finally 12. Lab 12 part 1 wasn&#39;t my favorite lab, but it was definintly they most educational one. I ended up writing everything correctly, but I had  issues with the error hanlding logic that were a nightmare to fix. As it turns out, the issue wasn&#39;t in my coding logic at all, but in the other file that I didn&#39;t write. After fixing the HasMatchingHeader function, all the tests for part 1 passed. This was one of the best feeling ever. </p>
