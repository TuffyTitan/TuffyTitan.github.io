# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Hudson Reilly and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Comp Sci with an emphasis in Cyber Security.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

   Lab 10, Parts 1 and 2 were both one of my favorite labs the semiester. I felt that part one was really nice letting me work hands on with the File input and output streams. I feel like in the feild of Data Science and Cybersecurity, being able to read from a file or a webpage is imparaitive, and automating this process is really fun to see and build. Part 2 was fun because it was my first hands on approach to two-dimentional vecotrs in c++. It took me a while to understand and manipulate the vecotrs that I was using but in the end I got a hold of what I was doing. 

* Lab 11

    During my summer internship, I worked with file input and output using CSV files, so seeing Lab 11 Part 1 made me happy. While my internship involved Python, it's nice to be able to do it natively in C++ without needing a library like Pandas to speed up the process. The one difficulty I had with this lab was using the ReadCSV function correctly. I probably spent an hour debugging when all I had to do was change a single number. I ended up swapping the rows and columns, so instead of putting 9 as the number of columns, I mistakenly put 67.
